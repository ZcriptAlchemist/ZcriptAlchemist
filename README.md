# 👋 Hey, I’m Suhail

**Backend engineer specializing in Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, and AWS with hands-on experience building scalable, real-world systems in fintech.** I care about clean architecture, sensible defaults, and shipping software that doesn’t break under pressure.  
Calm under chaos, driven by clarity, and always playing the long game, in code and in life.
